# 2bit_Adder_Design
This project features a 2-bit Adder Verilog module designed and synthesized using Synopsys Design Compiler, achieving a timing slack of 407 ps. The netlist was verified for correctness via timing analysis and waveform simulations. Automatic Place and Route (APR) was performed using Cadence Innovus, followed by DRC and LVS checks with Calibre, resulting in a clean layout with a total chip area of 382.787 μm². The design also involved Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS), floor planning, placement, and routing, optimized for a clock frequency of 2 GHz, ensuring full compliance with design constraints.
